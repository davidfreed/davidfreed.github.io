Early in 2024, I sat down to book all the travel I'd scheduled for the year. The process got me thinking about how to extract maximum savings from the byzantine video-game-like world of hotel, credit card, and airline loyalty programs. Available online resources contributed more to confusion than understanding, so I built my own tools and solutions. All of those have been shared below so others can benefit from the same work.  

**Primers**     
Simple algorithms to  maximize savings from standard travel (hotels, airlines). Consistent 10% list-price discounts are eminently achievable with <5min of work. Detailed proofs included.

**Tools**     
Sharing what I built for myself directly: 
- [Credit Card Optimizer](/ccoptimum.md). Used a quick algorithm to sift through the 70+ available options to determine my optimal stack. Saved thousands of dollars. Sharing for you to do the same!

I welcome any and all feedback to help get to the right answer. [Email me](mailto:freed.davidp@gmail.com?subject=What%20A%20Cool%20Article,%20Sir) with your thoughts!
