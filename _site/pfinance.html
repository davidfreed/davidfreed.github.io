            <p>Early in 2024, I sat down to book all the travel I'd scheduled for the year. The process got me thinking about how to extract maximum savings from the byzantine video-game-like world of hotel, credit card, and airline loyalty programs. Available online resources contributed more to confusion than understanding, so I built my own tools and solutions. All of those have been shared below so others can benefit from the same work.</p>

<p><strong>Primers</strong>   <br />
Simple algorithms to  maximize savings from standard travel (hotels, airlines). Consistent 10% list-price discounts are eminently achievable with &lt;5min of work. Detailed proofs included.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/airlines.html">Booking Flights: All Roads Lead Back to Chase</a></li>
  <li><a href="/hotels.html">Booking Hotels: Chase Remains Value-Town</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tools</strong>   <br />
Sharing what I built for myself directly:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/ccoptimum.html">Credit Card Optimizer</a>. Used a quick algorithm to sift through the 70+ available options to determine my optimal stack. Saved thousands of dollars. Sharing for you to do the same!</li>
</ul>

<p>I welcome any and all feedback to help get to the right answer. <a href="mailto:freed.davidp@gmail.com?subject=What%20A%20Cool%20Article,%20Sir">Email me</a> with your thoughts!</p>
